Floatie-Framework
=================

A float-loving responsive framework.

## About

This is not a *"real"* framework. It is very simple. Too simple.

A demo is available [here.](http://vrunn.github.io/Floatie-Framework/)

## How-to

### Classes

* fullcontainer: A 100% width wrapper for the full page. All the column layouts will give you a 5% margin per-side of the page, therefore occupy 90% of its width.
* twocol-left: Creates a column to the left.
* twocol-right: Creates a column to the right.
* twocol-small: Makes the column (only works for two columns) smaller.
* twocol-big: Makes the column bigger, also only works for two columns.
* clear: Clears. Self-explanatory. If you have floats, you need clears.
* threecol-left: Creates a column to the left, for 3 columns.
* threecol-center: Creates a column in the middle, for 3 columns.
* threecol-right: Creates a column to the right, for 3 columns.
* twocol-left-fourcol: If you wish to make a four column layout and you want it to stretch to 2 columns when there is not enough size, use this. Wrap the first two colums of the four in it.
* twocol-right-fourcol: Wrap the second two columns of the four in this.
* fourcol-left: First column of 4.
* fourcol-center-left: Second column of 4.
* fourcol-center-right: Third column of 4.
* fourcol-right: Fourth column.

## Notes

The maximum width is 1100px, once you get to 1100px the layout stops growing and aligns to the center of the page. Also, I haven't tested any form of column combination, all I tested is what you can see on the [demo.](http://vrunn.github.io/Floatie-Framework/)

## Please

Use this framework anywhere you want. Improve it, share it. It is really basic, I just made it for practice (and fun).

Regards!
