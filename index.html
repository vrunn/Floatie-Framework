                <p>Only one column of text here. Nothing more. Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not that they made him sea-sick—he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.</p>

                <p class="textcenter">As the animal approached the two, bellowing and pawing the ground with the strength of many earthly bulls, another door directly beneath us was opened, and from it issued the most terrific roar that ever had fallen upon my outraged ears. I could not at first see the beast from which emanated this fearsome challenge, but the sound had the effect of bringing the two victims around with a sudden start, and then I saw the girl's face—she was not Dian! I could have wept for relief.</p>

                <p>Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to "enlarge" your mind? Subtilize it.</p>

              <p>Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.</p>

              <p>In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.</p>

               <p>I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." I'll be sure to note that in my log. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties.</p>

               <p>My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? They were just sucked into space. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Travel time to the nearest starbase? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you.</p>

And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Not if I weaken first. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?</p>

               <p>I guess it's better to be lucky than good. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Besides, you look good in a dress. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Your head is not an artifact! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>
